# vLLM Image Security Scanner

Automated daily security scanning of the official [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)
Docker images. Each day this pipeline:

1. Finds the last 10 non-prerelease vLLM releases.
2. Scans every published image variant (`gpu`, `cpu`, `rocm`) with
   [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) — OS packages and Python
   packages.
3. Attempts an in-place `apt-get upgrade` + `pip install --upgrade` patch,
   and rescans the result.
4. Publishes the before/after vulnerability counts and pushes patched
   images to `ghcr.io/<owner>/vllm-security/<image-name>:<version>-<scan-date>`
   (e.g. `vllm-openai`, `vllm-openai-cpu`, `vllm-openai-rocm`; scan-date is a
   UTC `YYYYMMDD` stamp).

Full dashboard with historical trends: see the GitHub Pages site linked
below once the first scan has run. The dashboard also lets you pick any of
the last 7 scanned days and drill into the complete per-image vulnerability
report (not just counts).

Patched images are best-effort security-metrics artifacts, not supported
vLLM builds — functional correctness is not guaranteed.
